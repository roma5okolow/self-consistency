When the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, the car is 20 minutes away from the base of the tower. The time to reach the base of the tower is 30 minutes. The difference between 30 minutes and 20 minutes is 10 minutes. We know that the angle of elevation is increasing at 1 minute per second. So the change in angle is 10 minutes / 1 minute = 10. The answer is (b).\n\n", " The tower is at an angle of 60\u00b0 from the car, which is at an angle of 45\u00b0 from the tower. This means that the car is at an angle of 15\u00b0 from the tower.

The answer is (a).\n\n", " The total distance between A and B is the distance that Ram traveled plus the distance that Krishna traveled. The distance that Ram traveled is the distance from A to C. The distance that Krishna traveled is the distance from B to C. So the total distance between A and B is the sum of the distance that Ram traveled and the distance that Krishna traveled. The distance that Ram traveled is the distance from A to C. The distance that Krishna traveled is the distance from B to C. The distance that Ram traveled is 20m/s * 10 sec = 200 meters. The distance that Krishna traveled is 40m/s * 10 sec =", " Here, the distance from A to C is 10 seconds * 20 meters/second = 200 meters. And the distance from C to B is 10 seconds * 40 meters/second = 400 meters. The total distance between A and B is 200 + 400 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " The distance between A and B is 100 meters. The distance between A and C is 300 meters. The speed of Ram and Krishna are 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively. Since Ram will arrive before Krishna, they will meet at point C. The answer is (d).\n\n", " The distance between A and B is 500 meters. The distance between A and C is 150 meters. The distance between B and C is 450 meters. So the total distance is 1000 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " If they travel towards each other, they will meet at point C. So the distance between A to C is the same as the distance between C to B. The distance between A to B is (40m/s)(10 seconds) = 400 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " The total distance would be equal to the distance from A to C plus the distance from C to B. This is d = d1 + d2 = 20m/s * 10s + 40m/s * 14.286s = 700m + 560m = 1360m. The answer is (b).\n\n", " Ram and Krishna met 10 seconds after they left A, which means they met at a distance of 20 meters from A. So the total distance from point A to B is 20 meters.

The distance travelled by Ram from A to C and Krishna from B to C is 20 * 10 seconds = 200 meters and 40 * 10 seconds = 400 meters, respectively. The distance between A and C is 200 meters and C and B is 400 meters. The total distance between A to B is 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters. The answer is (d).\n\n", " The total distance between A to B is the distance that Ram covered and the distance that Krishna covered. If Ram covered 5 meters in 5 seconds, then he would have covered 500 meters in 50 seconds. If Krishna\ncovered 10 meters in 10 seconds, then he would have covered 1000 meters in 100 seconds. The total of Ram's distance and Krishna's distance is 1500 meters.\n\n", " The distance between points A and B is 500 meters. The distance between points A and C is 150 meters. The distance between B and C is 350 meters. The distance between A and B to A and C is 500 - 150 = 350 meters. The distance between B and C to A and C is 700 - 350 = 350 meters. The answer is (e).\n\n", " The distance between A and B is d. The distance between A and C is d/2. If Ram travels from C to B and Krishna travels from C to A, then the total distance traveled by Ram and Krishna will be d+d/2 + d/2+d. This is equal to 4d. The answer is (c).\n\n", " The distance from A to B is 100 meters. For Ram to meet Krishna at C, he must travel 100 meters in 10 seconds. For Krishna to meet Ram at C, he must travel 200 meters in 20 seconds. Since the two meet at C, the total distance from A to C is 200 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " The distance between A and B is d. But d = (x2 - x1) / 3. So d = (40m/s * 10s - 20m/s * 10s) / 3 = (400m - 200m) / 3 = 600m.

Since the three points are on the same line, the triangle formed by the three points has the same area. We can find the area of the triangle by the formula: 1 / 2 * base * height. 1 / 2 * (20m) * (40m)", " Ram and Krishna will meet at point C. Since Ram travels at 20 m/s, then after 10 seconds he will travel 20(10) = 200 meters. Krishna will travel 40 (10) = 400 meters. They meet at C, which is halfway between A and B, which is 500 meters. Therefore, the answer is (a).\n\n", " A distance of 700 meters is the answer.\n\n", " The total distance between A and B is the distance that Ram had covered before finding Krishna, plus the distance that Krishna had covered before finding Ram, minus the distance that they traveled in the same time. The distance that Ram had covered is 20m/s * 10s = 200 meters. The distance that Krishna had covered is 40m/s * 10s = 400 meters. The distance between the meeting point, C, and B is the distance that Ram had covered, plus the distance that Krishna had covered, minus the distance that they traveled in the same time. The distance between C and B is 200 meters + 400 meters -", " The distance between A and B is x. The speed of Ram and Krishna are v1 and v2 respectively. At the time of meeting, Ram is x / 10 meters ahead of Krishna. So, v1(x / 10) = v2(x - x / 10). This means x = 70 m. The distance between A and C is 70 m. The distance between C and B is x - 70 m. So, x = 70 + 70 = 140 m. The answer is (e).\n\n", "The total distance between A and B is equal to the distance from A to C plus the distance from C to B.

Since he travels toward Ram, he would have traveled a total of 400 meters toward Ram.\nThe total distance between Ram and Krishna is 200 + 400 = 600 meters. The answer is (e).\n\n", " The distance from A to B is 200 meters. The distance from A to C is 200 meters. The distance from B to C is 60 meters. Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 200 + 200 + 60 = 460 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " The total distance between A and B is D = v1 * t + (v1 - v2) * t. If we let v1 = 20m/s, v2 = 40m/s, and t = 10s, then D = 20 * 10 + (20 - 40) * 10. D = 600m, so the answer is (e).\n\n", " Krishna has a travel distance of (40 - 20) / 2 = 10 meters. So Krishna\u2019s distance to C is 10 meters.\nRam has a travel distance of (20 - 10) / 2 = 5 meters.

Let us call the total distance as di. di = d1 + d2. Here d1 is the distance for Ram to travel from A to C and d2 is the distance for Krishna to travel from C to B. d1 = 20 m/s * 10 seconds = 200 meters d2 = 40 m/s * 10 seconds = 400 meters So d1 + d2 = 600 meters. The answer is (d).\n\n", " Now, let's figure out the distance between A and B. Let's call the distance between A and B as S. After 10 seconds, both Ram and Krishna will be at the same distance from C. So, if the distance between A and C is X, the distance between B and C is Y, the distance between A and B is S, and the distance between A and C is X, and the distance between B and C is Y, then S = (X + Y) / 2. If we let S = 900 meters and X = 20 meters and Y = 800 meters, then we can solve for X", " The distance between A and B is 500 meters. Since Ram is traveling 20m/s, he would have traveled 20m / 10s = 200 meters. Similarly, Krishna would have traveled 40m / 10s = 400 meters. Since Ram and Krishna met at point C, the distance between A and C is 200 meters, and the distance between B and C is 400 meters. Thus, the distance between A and B is 200 meters more than the distance between A and C and the distance between B and C. Thus, the total distance is 700 meters. The answer is (a).\n'''", " The distance between A and B is 50 meters. If Ram and Krishna start from A and B at the same time, then the total distance between A and C is 50 meters. The distance between C and B is 50 meters. So, the distance between A and B is 50 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " Since the two cars are moving at 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, they will meet at C. This means that the distance between A and B is equal to the sum of the distances between A and C and B and C. If a + b = 20 + 40 = 60, then a = 40, b = 20. So AC = 40 * 10 = 400 meters and BC = 20 * 10 = 200 meters. So the total distance between A and B is 400 meters. The answer is (a).\n\n", " The formula for distance is speed * time.

So 40% of the water is 40% orange juice. And 40% of the orange juice is 40% water. So 1 gallon of orange juice is 40% orange juice and 60% water. So 60% of the orange juice is 60% water. So 0.6 gallons of water is 60% of the orange juice. So the answer", " If one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, then we can solve for the volume of orange juice that is added to the soft drink. First we will solve for the volume of orange juice that is in the soft drink. 60% of the soft drink is 60/100 = 0.6. So the volume of soft drink is 0.6. Then the volume of orange juice in the soft drink is 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24. The total volume of the soft drink is 0.24 + 0.6 = 0.84. Now, we will solve", " The quantity of orange juice is 40% of the total volume of the soft drink, so 40% = 0.4. The quantity of water is 60% of the total volume of the soft drink, so 60% = 0.6. The volume of the orange juice must be added is 0.6 minus 0.4, which is 0.2. Since the quantity of orange juice must be added is less than a gallon, it is 0.2 gallons. The answer is (c).\n\n", " The proportion of OJ to water is 40% / 60% which is 2/3. So 0.6 / 2/3 = 0.4 / 3. The answer is (c).\n\n", " The given problem is comparing the quantity of the liquid in terms of percentage of the mixture. The equation is 60% / 40% = 1 / 0.6. The answer is (b).\n\n", " The new percentage of the soft drink that is orange juice would be 60% + 60% = 120%. The number of gallons of orange juice needed to be added to the soft drink is 0.8. The answer is (b).\n\n", " The amount of water to be added would be 100% - 60%, which is 40%. So 1.5 liters of water are added to make the orange juice 60%. The answer is (c).\n\n", " If one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, then the amount of orange juice if 10% of the total volume of the drink. So 40% x 1 gallon = 0.4 gallon. So if the amount of orange juice is increased by 0.6 gallon, then the new amount of orange juice would have to be 0.6 gallon. So we have 0.6 gallon of water and 0.4 gallon of orange juice. So, 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.4) = 1/2. So, the answer is (a).\n\nQ", " 60% of the soft drink would be 60% of 1 gallon = 0.6 gallon. 40% of the soft drink would be 40% of 1 gallon = 0.4 gallon. The amount of orange juice in the soft drink would be 40% of 0.6 gallon = 0.24 gallon. To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add 0.24 gallon of additional orange juice to 1 gallon of soft drink. Addition of orange juice is an addition, not a multiplication, so the answer is (b).\n\n", " The proportion of orange juice to water is 60% to 40%. 60% of the soft drink is the target. So to make the soft drink 60% we would need 1.5 gallons of orange juice. The answer is (a).\n\n", " The addition of orange juice is enough to increase the percentage of orange juice over water to 60%. The answer is (c).\n\n", " The soft drink is 40% orange juice and 60% water. If the soft drink is 40% orange juice and 40% water, then it would be 60% water. The answer is (d).\n\n", " The percentage of orange juice in the soft drink is 40% + 60% = 100%. If we want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, then we need 60% of the soft drink to come from orange juice. So 60% = (40% + 60%) x 60%. This simplifies to 60% = 100% x 60%.\n\n", " The percentage of orange juice must be increased to 60%. This means that 40% of the original amount of soft drink is made of orange juice. So the amount of orange juice is 1.5 * 0.4 = 0.6 gallons. The total amount of soft drink is 1.5 gallons. The amount of water is 1.5 - 0.6 = 0.9. The answer is (c).\n\n", " The proportion of soft drink that is orange juice is 60 / 40 = 6 / 4 = 1.5. So the proportion of soft drink that is water is 40 / 60 = 4 / 6 = 2. The additional gallons of orange juice needed is 1.5 * (1 - 2) = 0.75 gallons. The answer is (c).\n\"\"\"\n\nanswer_keys = ['(b)', '(c)', '(a)', '(c)', '(a)', '(e)', '(b)', '(d)', '(b)', '(c)', '(a)', '(c)", " If 40% of the soft drink is orange juice, then 60% of the soft drink is water. Thus 100% of the soft drink is orange juice. To make 60% of the soft drink is orange juice, you would need to add 4/5 of a gallon of orange juice to make up the difference. So the answer is (d).\n\n", " The original amount of OJ is 40% = 40 / (40+60) = 40 / 100 = 0.4\nThe desired amount of OJ is 60% = 60 / (40+60) = 60 / 100 = 0.6\nThe difference is 0.1\nThe new amount is 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5. The answer is (a).\n\n", " If the soft drink is made of 40% orange juice, then it is 60% water. To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 of orange juice. Since we are adding orange juice, that means we are adding 100% water more. This means that the total will be 1.2 more than the original. So the answer is (c).\n\n"]}
